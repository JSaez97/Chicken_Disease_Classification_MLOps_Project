<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

The Chicken Disease Classification MLOps Project is an end-to-end solution that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and classify chicken diseases like the Coccidiosis, NCD or Salmonella from images, it also can detect if the chicken is healthy. It integrates a complete MLOps pipeline with Docker for containerization, AWS for cloud deployment, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD, ensuring automated, scalable, and efficient model deployment with minimal manual intervention. This project could help farmers and veterinarians monitor poultry health in real time.

<h2 align="left">Key Objectives</h2>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ¬†&nbsp;Disease Detection and Classification: Accurately identify different chicken diseases from images using CNN models.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ¬†&nbsp;Automation: Automate the process of data ingestion, model training, and deployment through MLOps principles.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ¬†&nbsp;Cloud Scalability: Deploy the app in a cloud environment (AWS ECS) for easy access, scalability, and reliability.

<h2 align="left">Datasets</h2>

The chosen dataset for this project is the [Chicken Disease Image Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allandclive/chicken-disease-1).

<h2 align="left">Future Improvements</h2>

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ¬†&nbsp; Create a custom web site related to the topic.

<h3 align="left">Getting Started with AWS Setup</h3>
i) Login to AWS Console:

‚Ä¢ Access your AWS account to configure the necessary services and permissions for deployment.

ii) Create an IAM User for Deployment:

&nbsp;‚Ä¢ Configure the user with the following permissions to access required AWS services:/
  &nbsp;‚Ä¢ EC2 Access: For managing the virtual machine./
  &nbsp;‚Ä¢ ECR Access: For storing Docker images in AWS's Elastic Container Registry.

iii) Set Up Permissions and Policies:

‚Ä¢ Attach the following policies to the IAM user to allow access:
  &nbsp;‚Ä¢ AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess: Grants full access to ECR./
  &nbsp;‚Ä¢ AmazonEC2FullAccess: Grants full control over EC2 resources.
