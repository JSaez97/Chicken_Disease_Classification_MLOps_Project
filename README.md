<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

▶️  &nbsp;The Chicken Disease Classification MLOps Project is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to detect and classify various diseases in chickens based on image data. This project leverages modern machine learning techniques, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to automate the detection process and provide real-time insights that can help farmers and veterinary professionals monitor the health of poultry populations.\
▶️  &nbsp;The project implements a full MLOps pipeline, utilizing tools like Docker for containerization, AWS for cloud-based deployment, and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). By integrating machine learning with operations, this project ensures seamless and scalable deployment of the model, reducing manual intervention and improving efficiency.\
